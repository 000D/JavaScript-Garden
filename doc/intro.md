## Intro

**JavaScript Garden** is a growing collection of documentation about the most 
quirky parts of the JavaScript. It gives advice to avoid common coding
mistakes, subtle bugs, as well as performance issues non expert JavaScript
programmers may encounter on their endeavours into the depths of the language.

JavaScript Garden does **not** insist on teaching JavaScript. Former knowledge
of the language is recommended in order to understand the topics covered in this
guide. If you want to learn the language first, please head over to the excellent
[Guide][1] on the Mozilla Developer Network.
