## Intro

**JavaScript Garden** is a growing collection of documentation about the most 
quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language. It gives advice for
avoiding common coding mistakes, subtle bugs, as well as performance issues 
and bad practices non expert JavaScript programmers may encounter on their 
endeavours into the depths of the language.

JavaScript Garden does **not** insist on teaching JavaScript. Former knowledge
of the language is strongly recommended in order to understand the topics covered
in this guide. If you want to learn the language first, please head over to the 
excellent [Guide][1] on the Mozilla Developer Network.

JavaScript Garden also focuses on the 3rd Edition of the EcmaScript
