JavaScript Garden - A Guide for JavaScript Core
===============================================

**JavaScript Garden** is a growing collection of documentation about the most 
quirky parts of the JavaScript. It gives advice to avoid common coding
mistakes, subtle bugs, as well as performance issues non expert JavaScript
programmers may encounter on their endeavours into the depths of the language.

JavaScript Garden does **not** insist on teaching JavaScript. Former knowledge
of the language is recommended in order to understand the topics covered in this
guide.

Besides a lot of copy-editing and rewording / styling for consistency, the
following topics are currently missing from the guide:

 - The evil `eval`
 - The Global Object
