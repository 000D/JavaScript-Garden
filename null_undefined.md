### Null and Undefined

There's some confusion about what those two values are used for.

`null` is a keyword and a type. `undefined` is just a type, but there's also the
variable `undefined` which defaults to the value of `undefined` but its value
**can** be changed. All variables that have not been assigned any value, default
to the *value* `undefined`.
